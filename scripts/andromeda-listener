#   Andromeda Manager - v14.3 (Legacy bindfs Syntax)
#
#   - This version uses the older '--exclude' syntax for bindfs to support
#     older installations of the tool.
#   - It includes pre-emptive unmounting and post-mount verification.
#
#   ** DEPENDENCY: This script requires 'bindfs' to be installed. **
